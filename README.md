==============================

This is a test to add some text.

Here lie the files associated with SkilledUp Academy's Introduction to HTML & CSS program. Files are separated into two folders:

- "final" is an example of the completed portfolio/resume site that a learner build throughout the course.
- "activities" is the answers to the final activity for each challenge that requires an update to the learners index page. Each file is titled "index-challenge-#.html" to indicate which challenge it represents. There is only one css file (style.css), but it is commented with the answers for each challenge.

This code is not meant to be shared directly with the learner, as the intention for the final activity in each challenge is to use what they have learned and practiced in earlier in activities in the challenge on their own. And the final project should also be like this. This repository is meant to assist mentors in coaching their learners.
